# SQL Exercises
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the SQL Tutorial on sqlzoo.net. The tutorial covers a wide range of SQL concepts, including basic querying, aggregating data, joining tables, and subqueries.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a different section of the tutorial and contains the SQL code for each exercise, along with a brief explanation of what the exercise is asking for and my solution.

# How to Use
To view my solutions, simply navigate to the corresponding subdirectory and open the .sql file for the exercise you're interested in. You can copy and paste the code into your own SQL editor to test and modify it as needed.

# Contributing
If you notice any errors or have suggestions for improving my solutions, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. I'm always looking to learn and improve my SQL skills!

# Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank the creators of the SQL Tutorial for providing such a comprehensive and accessible resource for learning SQL.
