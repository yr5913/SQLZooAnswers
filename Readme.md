# SQL Exercises
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the SQL Tutorial on sqlzoo.net. The tutorial covers a wide range of SQL concepts, including basic querying, aggregating data, joining tables, and subqueries.

Each SQL file corresponds to a different section of the tutorial and contains the SQL code for each exercise, along with a brief explanation of what the exercise is asking for and my solution.
